/**
 * Exercise 2.1 asks to implement a program that queries the filesize of a 
 * file, allocates memory for it, loads the file into memory and counts the
 * occurences of the string 'abcabc'. Matches may overlap, so 'abcabcabc' has
 * 2 matches. The program should be as fast as possible.
 * 
 * To count the occurences I built a state machine that may transition into 
 * the next state with inputs a, b or c. Any other input will transition to
 * state 0. The state machine deals well with overlaps and it runs in Î˜(n) 
 * time. To further speed the program up, calculating the next transition from
 * a state and an input is done without branching.
 *
 * The program does make a few assumptions: 
 *   - Characters are sizeof(char) bits. It probably breaks under encodings
 *     that use more space and espicially variable width.
 *   - The computer it runs on represents negative integers as two's complement
