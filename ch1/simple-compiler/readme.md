This is a compiler for the language generated by the following grammer:

    expression -> digit | '(' expression operator expression ')'
    operator   -> '+' | '-'
    digit      -> '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'

It is structured after the demo compiler described in chapter 1.2 of "Modern Compiler Design"
